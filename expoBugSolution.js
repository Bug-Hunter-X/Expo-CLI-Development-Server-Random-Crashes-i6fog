The provided solution focuses on improving error handling and ensuring resources are released correctly.  In the original `expoBug.js`, there may be unhandled exceptions, memory leaks, or improper resource handling. In this improved `expoBugSolution.js`, we use `try...catch` blocks around potentially problematic areas of code, check the status of network requests before proceeding, and add proper cleanup of resources like timers, listeners, or large data structures.
