# Expo CLI Development Server Random Crashes

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo CLI development server crashes randomly without providing helpful error messages.  The application functions normally for a while before the server unexpectedly terminates.

## Problem

The development server, started with `expo start`, periodically crashes without any clear indication in the console. This makes debugging extremely challenging as there is no apparent error to trace. The behavior is inconsistent and difficult to reproduce reliably.

## Solution

The solution attempts to address the problem by implementing various checks and improvements within the application's logic to reduce potential causes of server crashes. This involves checking the state of network requests, handling async operations more efficiently, and implementing more robust error handling throughout the application.
