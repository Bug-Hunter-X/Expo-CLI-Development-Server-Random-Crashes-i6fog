While developing a React Native application using Expo CLI, I encountered an unusual error where the development server would randomly crash without providing a clear error message in the console. The application would run fine for a period, but after some time or a certain action, the server would terminate, and I'd have to restart it manually. This behavior was inconsistent and unpredictable, making debugging extremely difficult.
